watch_later_tool

Today I finally got fed up about my Watch Later playlist being at capacity for almost a month now and me having to clean it out bit by bit. I created a Keyboard Maestro shortcut which helps you to clear out your watch later playlist, without losing the videos you have added to it. What the script does:

1. Move a video to your top youtube playlist (watch later not included)
2. Delete your video from watch later
3. Rinse & Repeat for as many videos as you want

*Bugs:*

It can't quite deal with videos made private and will glitch out when it tries to add a private yt video to another playlist, so keep an eye out for that.

The automation will be here and I invite people to create their own version (maybe using different software or for different platforms) and pushing it to the github repo so other people can find it too.

As time goes on I might make it a more sophisticated script or even a standalone tool but I'd need some help for that.
